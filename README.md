# Classify Proposal
### Project title

Classify

### What and why?

Classify is an web app that takes a Spotify users liked songs and provides an option to create playlists based on different elements of the songs (ex. artist, genre, release year, popularity, bpm, energy, danceability).
Spotify creates playlists like these for each user but they often contain songs that are not liked and even songs that the user has never listened to. Classify focuses on songs that are liked to ensure that each playlist is more accurate to what the user actually enjoys listening to.

### For whom?

Classify is targeted towards Spotify who have hundreds to thousands of liked songs and want to sort them. 

### How?

From an end-user's perspective:
* The user will first be brought to the sign-up page where they are asked to sign into Spotify.
* The user is then brought to a screen that shows a list of their liked songs along with some of the categories that they fit into.
* The user is able to manually edit these categories if they feel that the results are inaccurate or they want to prevent a certain song from showing up in playlists of that category.
* There will also be an option to remove all changes and return to the default categories. There will also be an option to create a playlist.
* Upon clicking on this, a menu appears showing all of the different categories attatched to your liked songs. The user is able to create a playlist mixing as many categories they choose.
* Once the playlist is created, the user is given an option to save the playlist to Spotify.

### Scope

The proposal for Classify is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester using Spotify's API.
